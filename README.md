Xenon Controller Recorder v02.92.08.0301

Xenon Controller Recorder title include file.
Include this file from either your global include file or each file that calls XTL input functions to add XeCR to your title.

Created 2004/09/21 Rich Bonny <rbonny@microsoft.com>, based on XCR.h of XCR2 (Xbox Controller Recorder 2).
Most macros and namespaces retain references to XCR rather than XeCR to maximize the commonality between implementations.
